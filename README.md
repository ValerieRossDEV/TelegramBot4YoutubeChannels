# TelegramBot4YoutubeChannels

This is a TelegramBot for scraping our own YoutubeChannel. It sends statistics updates on YT channel subsribers and latest video to a destined Telegram group.

I recommend to use a VPN with non-EU IP addresses. Youtube seems to like to ask for cookies approval with EU IP addresses, therefore interrupting the programflow.

Made with the help of Selenium and https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots.
